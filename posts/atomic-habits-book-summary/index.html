Suffering is the state between craving a change in state and achieving it.\n This is my notes from the book Atomic Habits by James Clear\nThe Fundamentals Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits  The effects of small habits compound over time. If you can get 1% better each day, by the end of the year you’d have become 37 times better. Conversely with bad habits, if you had have become 1% worse every day for one year you’ll decline nearly down to zero.   The task of breaking bad habits is like uprooting an awk from within us The task of creating good habits is like cultivating a flower plant one day at a time. A bamboo takes 5 years to establish an extensive network of roots underneath before it starts to grow from the ground up, after that it only take it 6 weeks to reach 90 feet (~27 Meeters) into the air. This is the case for bad habits as well. If you are having a chronic back pain, chances are it have not developed overnight as it is apparent. It may be the result of all the tiny yoga/workouts you missed to do everyday that have created a compounding effect of bad habits which have caused that chronic pain.  Plateau of Latent Potential  When there is no short term reward for the tiny directions/actions you take, people will often get demotivated. When you fail to see a tangible result, you decide to stop. In order to make meaningful difference, habits needs to persist long enough to break through this plateau — what the author calls the Plateau of Latent Potential If you find yourself struggling to build good habits or break bad ones, you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential When nothing seems to work, the author watches a stonecutter hammering a stone to break it. He might have taken 25 hits to finally break it. We know that it is not just the 25th hit that have broken the stone, but all that have gone before.  Goals are good in setting a direction, but systems are beset for making progress. Problems when you spend too much time thinking about goals and not design a system\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals If successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change Imagine you have a messy room and the goal is to clean the room. And one day you summon the energy to clean it, then you’ll have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a pile of clutter and hopping for another burst of motivation.\n You are left chasing the sane outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treat the symptom without addressing the cause. The cause is your unorganized behavior. What you should be addressing is to create a system to be organized.  Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness  The implicit assumption behind a goal is that: “Once I achieve my goal, then I will be happy”. The problem with goal first mentality is that you are continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are disappointed. A system-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to give yourself to be happy. You can be happy anytime and every time your system is running. A system can be successful in may different forms, not just the one you envisioned the first time.  Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress  You find people often themselves reverting to their old habits after they accomplish a goal. The purpose of setting a goal is to win the game. The purpose of building system is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It is not about a single accomplishment, but a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvements. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.  Chapter 2: How your habits shape your identity and (vice versa) Identity based behavior change:\n  There are three layers of behavior change\n A change in your outcomes (loosing weight, publishing a book..) A change in your process (developing a meditation routine) A change in your identity (believes, biases, and wold view)    All these levels are good, the problem is in the direction of change.\n  Imagine you are a smoker and want to quit smoking. When someone offered a cigarette you refused by saying.\n I am trying to quit I am not a smoker    The person giving the first response actually believes that he is a smoker. And have created that belief have come from the identity he have created.\n  In the second response the person actually does not identifies with someone who smokes. It is part of their former self and he is not that person anymore.\n  When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. Whe you make your bed everyday you embody the identity of an organized person When you do meditation/yoga everyday you embody the identity of a spiritual person\n The more you repeat a behavior. The more you re-enforce the identity associated with that behavior The most effective way the change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you want to become  Chapter 3: How to build habits in 4 simple steps All habits proceed through four stages in the same order:\n  Cue, craving, response, and reward\n Cue: anything that triggers a craving. (seeing someone smoke, an advertisement, smell of food) Craving: anything that creates an ardent need for a response. (craving to smoke, craving to eat) Response: any action that produces a reward Reward: anything that is very satisfying    The key for creating new habits:\n Cue: Make it obvious Craving: Make it attractive Response: Make it easy Reward: Make it satisfying    The key for breaking bad habits:\n Cue: Make it invisible Craving: Make it unattractive Response: Make it difficult Reward: Make it unsatisfying    The First law: Make it Obvious Chapter 4: Man who didn’t look right  With enough practice / repetition. Your brain will pick up on the cues that predicts certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once habit become automatic when we stop paying attention to it. The cue, craving, response will happen automatically that we are hardly conscious of it. The reason that habits are forming is because we can push the the repetitive task to auto-pilot and reduce cognitive load. It will be hard to identify an habit that have become automatic. Eg:  Switching on the lights in a dark room. Completing others sentences   Some of the habits are very hidden to self, and only become aware when someone points it out to you. Pointing and calling raises your level of awareness.  By verbalizing your actions you become more conscious and awareness.  People who are doing repetitive work which are critical (Aircraft QA, train operator) often uses pointing and calling to raise their awareness and reduce the error.      Chapter 5: The best way to start a new habit   1st law of behavioral change is to make it Obvious\n  Two most common cues are time and location. Strategies like Implementation intention and Habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious habits.\n  Implementation intention:\n I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]    Habit Stacking:\n After [CURRENT_HABIT], I will [NEW_HABIT]    Chapter 6: Motivation is overrated. Environment matters more  People often chose products not because what they are, but because where they are. Environment is the invisible cue that shape human behavior. Behavior is the function of person in the environment.  B = f(P,E)   Every habit is initiated by a cue, we are more likely to notice the cue that stand out.  If you want to practice more Guitar, place the Guitar in the living room where you cannot fail to notice   Make the cues of the good habits obvious in your environment. It is easier to build new habits in new environment because you are not fighting against the old cues.  Chapter 7: Secret to Self-Control  Inversion of 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it invisible Once a habit if formed it is unlikely to be forgotten  This to me at first seemed to me as a bad thing. Because I want have overcome some pretty bad habits myself which I am ashamed of now. The fact that they are never forgotten made me worried. After I spend some time thinking about this made me realize this is actually a good thing. You need not forget this habit, it is better to remember them so that you know what are the bad effects of that and will probably help you in not going back to this habit loop again.   It is easier to avoid temptation than to resist it. One of the most practical ways to avoid a bad habit is to reduce the exposure to the cue that cause it. Self control is a short term strategy, not a long one.  The second law: Make it attractive Chapter 8: How to make a Habit Irresistible  The more attractive Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate a reward.  The reward system that is activated when you anticipate a reward is same as the one that gets activated when you receive a reward. The brain has more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The fact that our brain allocates more spaces for craving and desire provide evidence for the crucial roles these process play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. It is the craving that leads to response.   Habits are dopamine driven feedback loops. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.  It is the anticipation of the reward, not the fulfillment of it that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\nUse temptation bundling\n The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do  Chapter 9: The role of family and friends in shaping your habits Humans are heard animals, we want to fit in, bond with others and become acceptable. This nature of us is rooted in our evolution. When we are accepted in a tribe, we have access to shared resources, higher chances of mating and increased safety. As a result, on of the deepest human desire is to belong.\nBehaviors are attractive when they help us fit in This ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior. The need to “fit in” drives most of our actions and behavior. The rules of these vary from culture and time in history. The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\n “In the long history of mankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most efficiently prevailed.” - Charls Darwin We tend to adopt and imitate the habits that are praised and approved by our culture, because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.  We imitate the behaviors of three groups in particular:\n The close (family and friends) The many (the tribe) The powerful (those with status and privilege)  Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior change and make our habits more attractive.\n1. The close We tend to imitate the behaviors of the people we are close with. The need to fit-in and belong are so deep rooted in us, often these habit formation are subconscious. I have seen myself use some words that are used by close colleagues.\n Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to cultivate. You’ll rise together To make this strategy even more better, you can take this strategy one step further.  Join a culture (1) where your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.  The change become more appealing because it feels like something people like you do.     The need to belong to a group is a great motivator.  The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\nIf a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\n2. Imitating the many The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the normal behavior of the individual There is a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart or finding the truth.\nMost days we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. When changing the habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing the habits means fitting with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the powerful We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. Once we fit in we want to stand out Many of our daily habits are imitation of people we admire. We try to copy the behavior or the successful people because we want success ourselves. We are highly motivated to avoid the behavior that will lower our status. “What will others think of me” - is the driving factor in most of our actions.\n The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive.  Chapter 10: How to find and fix the cause of your bad habits Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. The current behavior is not the best way to solve the problem you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution to a problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.\n The inversion if 2nd Law of Behavior Change is to make it “Unattractive” You habits are modern-day solution to ancient desires. Highlight the benefits of avoiding bad habits, to make it seem unattractive.  Chapter 11: Walk slowly, but never backwards If motion does not lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need a plan or lean more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allow us to feel like we are making progress, without running the risk of failure. The biggest reason we slip into motion is because we want to delay failure.\n The third law of behavior change is Make it easy The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning Focus on taking action, not being in motion The number of time you have been performing an action is more important than the amount of time you have been performing it.  Chapter 12: The law of least effort  Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment that where doing the thing you want is very easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good habits, where friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.  Chapter 13: How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule  Habits are like entrance to a ramp highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you are speeding towards the next behavior. There are decisive movements in a day (life) that decides the rest of the course of your day (life). Understanding these decisive moments are very important to control the outcome of your day (life).  The two minute rule: When you are starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do  Read before each night: “Read one page” Do thirty minute yoga: “Take our my yoga mat” Study for class: “Open my notes”  The point is to master the habit of showing up. You have to standardize before you optimize. You are taking the smallest action that confirms the person you want to be.\n The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. It is better to do less than you hoped than doing nothing at all. Habits can be completed in a few seconds, but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterword. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.  Chapter 14: How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible  The inversion of 3rd lar of behavior change is make it difficult.
