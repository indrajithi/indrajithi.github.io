> Cohort retention analysis is a powerful method for understanding how user engagement and retention evolve over time. It allows businesses to identify patterns and trends in user behavior, helping to optimize product offerings and marketing strategies. In this blog post, I will walk through the steps to create a cohort retention analysis using Google BigQuery. We'll use an example dataset to illustrate each step and explain how to interpret the results.


## What is a Cohort?

A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period. For example, a cohort could consist of users who signed up for your service in a particular week or month. By analyzing the behavior of these cohorts over time, you can gain insights into user retention and engagement.

## What is Retention?

Retention refers to the ability of a product or service to keep its users over time. High retention rates indicate that users are satisfied and continue to return, while low retention rates can signal issues with user experience or product value.
