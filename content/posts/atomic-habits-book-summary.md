## The Fundamentals

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- The effects of small habits compound over time. 
- If you can get 1% better each day, by the end of the year you'd have become 37 times better. 
- Conversely with bad habits, if you had have become 1% worse every day for one year you'll decline nearly down to zero.

- The task of breaking bad habits is like uprooting an awk from within us
- The task of creating good habits is like cultivating a flower plant one day at a time.
- A bamboo takes 5 years to establish an extensive network of roots underneath before it starts to grow from the ground up, after that it only take it 6 weeks to reach 90 feet (~27 Meeters) into the air.
- This is the case for bad habits as well. If you are having a chronic back pain, chances are it have not developed overnight as it is apparent. It may be the result of all the tiny yoga/workouts you missed to do everyday that have created a compounding effect of bad habits which have caused that chronic pain.

#### Plateau of Latent Potential

- When there is no short term reward for the tiny directions/actions you take, people will often get demotivated. When you fail to see a tangible result, you decide to stop.
- In order to make meaningful difference, habits needs to persist long enough to break through this plateau â€” what the author calls the *Plateau of Latent Potential*
- If you find yourself struggling to build good habits or break bad ones, you have not yet crossed the *Plateau of Latent Potential*
- When nothing seems to work, the author watches a stonecutter hammering a stone to break it. He might have taken 25 hits to finally break it. We know that it is not just the 25th hit that have broken the stone, but all that have gone before.

### Chapter 2: How your habits shape your identity and (vice versa)

**Identity based behavior change:**

- There are three layers of behavior change
  1. A change in your outcomes (loosing weight, publishing a book..)
  2. A change in your process (developing a meditation routine)
  3. A change in your identity (believes, biases, and wold view)

- All these levels are good, the problem is in the direction of change.

- Imagine you are a smoker and want to quit smoking. When someone offered a cigarette you refused by saying.
  1. I am trying to quit
  2. I am not a smoker

- The person giving the first response actually believes that he is a smoker. And have created that belief have come from the identity he have created.
- In the second response the person actually does not identifies with someone who smokes. It is part of their former self and he is not that person anymore.

When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person.
Whe you make your bed everyday you embody the identity of an organized person
When you do meditation/yoga everyday you embody the identity of a spiritual person

- The more you repeat a behavior. The more you re-enforce the identity associated with that behavior
- The most effective way the change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you want to become

### Chapter 3: How to build habits in 4 simple steps

**All habits proceed through four stages in the same order:**

- Cue, craving, response, and reward
  1. Cue: anything that triggers a craving. (seeing someone smoke, an advertisement, smell of food)
  2. Craving: anything that creates an ardent need for a response. (craving to smoke, craving to eat)
  3. Response: any action that produces a reward
  4. Reward: anything that is very satisfying

- The key for creating new habits:

  1. Cue: Make it obvious
  2. Craving: Make it attractive
  3. Response: Make it easy
  4. Reward: Make it satisfying

- The key for breaking bad habits:

  1. Cue: Make it invisible
  2. Craving: Make it unattractive
  3. Response: Make it difficult
  4. Reward: Make it unsatisfying
