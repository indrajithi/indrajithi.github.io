## Why

I am staying in a hostel in Bangalore for some days. They hired a cook and opened a kitchen in the Hostel. To order food we have to call the cook and place the order. The menu is on the wall near the kitchen. After a few days of ordering food by calling the cook. It occurred to me that a QR based food ordering would be nice here. It needs to be very simple. Scan the QR, select the items, place the order. No phone verification or OTP nonsense.

User flow:

1. Scan the QR code near your bed or the space you are in (balcony, living room etc)
2. After clicking on the link in the QR, a web application will show all the menu items available.
3. Select the items you want and place the order.
4. The order will be placed through your whatsapp to the cooks whatsapp number.

This way there is no need to verify the user who created the order. The cook can know which bed or space you placed the order from and bring you the order.

I wrote some code using react and node and create a prototype in two days. Showed it to people and they loved the user experience.

I went live in a week. Show the video.

Integrated mixplanel to understand the insights into how customers are using the application. (show image)

The property managers loved the idea and asked me to onboard seven other airbnbs they have.

Challenge.

1. Expertise in tech
2. Had quit the job the take a break
3. Funding
4. Sales
5. Co-founder

Other ideas I have in mind in the same space:

1. POS
2. Restaurant inventory
3. Supply chain
